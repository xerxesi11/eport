Loans come from banks, credit unions, or sometimes even the government, and they are used for many things like going to college, buying a car, or starting a business. When you take out a loan, you sign a contract that explains how much you\’re borrowing, how long you have to pay it back, and how much interest you\’ll owe. People take out loans when they need to make big purchases they can\’t afford to pay for all at once. For example, many students use student loans to help pay for college. A loan can help you reach goals sooner, like getting a car for work or investing in your education. However, it\’s important to understand the responsibility that comes with borrowing money. You\’re expected to pay back the full amount, plus interest, on time—otherwise, your credit score and future finances can be affected. Loans work by setting up a repayment plan. This usually means paying a fixed amount every month for a set number of years. The longer it takes to repay the loan, the more interest you may end up paying overall. There are different types of loans, including secured loans (like car loans, backed by something valuable) and unsecured loans (like personal loans, which don\’t require collateral but may have higher interest rates). Always read the terms carefully before agreeing to a loan, and only borrow what you know you can repay. We have a loan calculator on this website! Click the top right corner.';
