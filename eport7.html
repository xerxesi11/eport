It allows you to buy things now and pay for them over time. Credit can come in different forms, such as credit cards, loans, or financing plans. When used responsibly, credit can be a helpful tool. However, it also requires discipline—if you borrow too much or miss payments, it can lead to debt and financial problems. Credit is important because it affects your financial future. When you borrow money, lenders keep track of how well you pay it back through something called a credit score. A good credit score can help you qualify for better loans, lower interest rates, and even housing or job opportunities. On the other hand, bad credit can make borrowing more expensive or harder to get. Learning how to manage credit wisely while you\’re young can help you build a strong financial foundation. Using credit wisely means borrowing only what you can afford to repay, paying your bills on time, and keeping balances low. It\'s smart to track your spending and avoid using credit for things you don\’t really need. Start small—some teens begin building credit by becoming authorized users on a parent\’s card or by getting a student card in college. Always read the terms before borrowing and remember: credit is a tool, not free money.';
